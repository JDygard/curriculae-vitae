# "Lights Out!" - Dygard edition

[Lights Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) was a handheld game system I owned as a child. I chose it to represent my skills in React on my portfolio because:

- It shows that I know how to manage state
- It is complex enough to show I can create something concise but robust
- It was a good learning experience to practice new skills
